# Find IPPL includes and library
#
# IPPL (Independent Parallel Particle Layer) is an object-oriented framework for
# particle based applications in computational science requiring high-performance
# parallel computers. It is a library of C++ classes designed to represent common
# abstractions in these applications. IPPL is based on data-parallel programming
# at the highest abstraction layer. Codes developed on serial workstations port to
# all supported architectures, including parallel processors. The supported
# platforms are: Linux based Beowulf clusters, Cray XT3/4, SGI Ultrix and IBM
# SP3/4.

# IPPL_INCLUDE_DIR - where to find ippl.h
# IPPL_LIBRARY     - qualified libraries to link against.
# IPPL_FOUND       - do not attempt to use if "no" or undefined.
